# benchmarks/browser

Runs WebAssembly benchmarks in a web browser.

## Running
Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed. Install `webpack-dev-server` globally (`npm install -g webpack-dev-server`). Then run with `webpack-dev-server`. A server hosting the benchmark page then runs at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
